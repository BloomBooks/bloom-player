<!-- To test bloom-player in a stand-alone browser page, copy this to the dist folder and open it in a browser,
    with a param url pointing to the folder containing the bloom book. For example,
file:///C:\github\bloom-player\dist\testPage.htm?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/BloomLibraryBooks-Sandbox/ken@example.com/aa5b9928-d38b-44ca-b013-512c57fd5094/(35a)+Share+It+Fair

This would also be the typical content for the root page of an iframe or WebView when deploying bloom-player. In that case, the src of the iframe must
both point to a suitable file (like this) and give the book folder url.
