// This block is boilerplate stuff from segment.io.  It is only modified by automatic line breaking and
// to pass typescript, to remove the automatic root-page notification, to extract the line that sets the
// ID so we can make that configurable, and to load a modified analytics.min.js that uses one of our
// proxies rather than sending directly to segment.io.
// Note that this file is adapted from the one used by BloomLibrary2.
