/* This API is for use by interactive pages */

/*
    Interactive pages call this in order to
    1) update the score that someday we may display on each page, and ( <---- Not implemented yet )
    2) optionally contribute to one analytics score. The category/label for that analytics has to be
    given to this twice: first in a data-analyticsCategories attribute on the page, and secondly in the
    call. The attribute is used to identify all the pages which are expected to contribute to
    this analytics score; it will be sent when all of them have (see below).

    Notes:
    * Pages can call this as many times as they want (e.g. after every click if that makes sense); this will
        take care of replacing the old score with the new.
    * .... Except, only the first call for a page counts for analytics. The thinking here is that currently,
    * we are only using analytics for comprehension, and there, it doesn't make sense to let the user try
    * over and over. However, it might well make sense to update the score they see on screen. If ever we
    * have some analytics scale that *does* make sense to be updatable, e.g. a "Please rate this book", then
    * we can always add a new parameter to this method to control that.
    *
    * We don't currently (May 2019) have a way to tell the page "this is your last chance to report a score".
    * Rather, we send the analytics immediately when every page that has this analyticsCategory (in its
    * data-analyticsCategories list) has reported at least once.
    * The category "comprehension" is special. For backwards compatibility with an old implementation
    * of comprehension questions, both the event name and parameters of the event are modified (at least
    * by bloom-reader2; not here).
