<!-- To use bloom-player, make an iframe or WebView whose content is a file like this,
    with a param url pointing to the folder containing the bloom book. For example,
   <iframe src="\bloomplayer.htm?url='https:\\example.com\mybook"></iframe>

To test bloom-player in a stand-alone browser page, copy this file to the dist folder and open it in a browser,
    with a param url pointing to the folder containing the bloom book. For example,
file:///C:\github\bloom-player\dist\bloomplayer.htm?url=https://localhost:...
Note that if the book as well as the bloomplayer.htm page are local files, cross-domain rules will
force you to serve the book folder from a local server that supplies CORS permissions,
unless it is a subfolder of the one that contains bloomplayer.htm.
If you see the 'Starting...' hanging around, this means that the Javascript in bloomPlayer.min.js from
bloom-player-controls.init() which calls ReacDOM.render() has failed to replace the body
of the document with the root react control. (Eventually we hope the user won't see even a flash of this.)
Contrast with 'loading...' which indicates that the React magic is happening, but the book document is
not yet loaded into the carousel.
