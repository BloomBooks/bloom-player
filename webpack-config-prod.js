    // https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking#minify-the-output seems
    // to indicate that as long as package.json indicates our module is
    // sideEffects: false, and mode: is production (above), tree shaking will
    // happen. I did not find this to be the case.

    // indicates that getting it requires a minimizer, and recommends uglifyjs.
    // However, our pre-minification bloomPlayer.js somehow contains const
    // declarations, even though our tsconfig.js has "target": "es5", which
    // I think should prevent it. UglifyJs can't handle that. Yet another site
    // recommended using TerserPlugin instead, as I have tried here. However, it
    // also doesn't seem to do tree shaking. I'm not sure whether this minifier is not
    // capable of it, or whether there is yet another setting I haven't found yet.
    // That's as far as I got before switching to second-level imports to avoid
    // most of the material-ui bloat. I'm keeping this change because it does
    // produce some reduction in the size of bloomPlayer.min.js, though I suspect it
    // is just from minification, not tree-shaking. (Currently from 770K to 351K.)
    // Note: if we do get tree-shaking working, we may need to change the sideEffects: false
    // in our own package.json to prevent shaking our CSS. See comment there.
